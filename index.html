            <p>
                Hello, and thank you for taking the time to check out my personal
                website! I have a passion for learning, which not only includes
                just Web Development. I am a novice-level German language 
                enthusiast, and have been learning one-on-one with my tutor
                since early April of 2020.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before I discovered my passion for Web Development, I worked
                in management of various operations. At age 21, I became the General
                Manager of a fast food restaurant, a position I held for almost three
                years before deciding it was not sustainable. Since then, I have gained 
                experience in retail, and now I am currently a supervisor in the gaming
                industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have always been a "nerd" at heart, but after discovering my
                passion for Web Development, my life changed. I have since re-enrolled 
                in school in pursuit of a related degree, which I am finishing in the
                Spring of 2021. When it comes to Web Development, I have experience in 
                the following categories:
                <ul class="removeBullets">
                    <li>Front-end using HTML5, CSS and vanilla JavaScript</li>
                    <li>ReactJS</li>
                    <li>Back-end using NodeJS</li>
                    <li>Template Engines</li>
                    <li>Web Scraping</li>
                    <li>Data Analysis/Visualization</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                I have discovered that I am at my best when I am consistently learning
                and progressing myself. At this point, I don't see any other way to live.
