                        This is a simplified version of a scheduling tool that I created and use on a weekly 
                        basis. Currently in beta, it is also being tested by multiple groups for handling scheduling
                        at their respective locations as well. In a nutshell, it is a Google Workspace application 
                        that is used for the development, collaboration, management, and distribution of schedules 
                        for any business. It also handles tracking the amount of workers at any given time, saving and 
                        marking request-off dates submitted by associates, placing associates in different groups,  
                        schedule appearance customizations, and more. To avoid the use of any permissions scopes, this link 
                        leads to a simplified version that lacks any of the server functionality, such as saving or loading
                        schedules and sending emails.

                        I made this basic website for a colleague to help 
                        them sell their product. It is my first project that was 
                        completed and deployed. Due to limited supply and to 
                        prevent supply issues, there isn't a payment gateway 
                        set up. All orders are handled one-by-one.
