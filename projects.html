                        This is a lightweight version of a scheduling tool that I created and use on a weekly 
                        basis. Currently in beta, it is also being tested by multiple groups for handling scheduling
                        at their respective locations as well. In a nutshell, it is a Google Workspace application 
                        that is used for the development, collaboration, management, and distribution of schedules 
                        for any business. It also handles tracking the amount of workers at any given time, saving and 
                        marking request-off dates submitted by associates, placing associates in different groups,  
                        schedule appearance customizations, and more. To avoid the use of any permissions scopes, this link 
                        leads to a simplified version that lacks any of the server functionality, such as saving or loading
                        schedules and sending emails. A demo of the full could be done if requested.

                        "Bartender" is a small starter app I made using ReactJS and a little Bootstrap. In its current form,
                        Bartender consumes the "CocktailDB" API to generate a list of 20 of the most popular
                        cocktails. The user selects a cocktail from this list to display its information, which 
                        includes: ingredients, instructions on how to make it, and an image. In the future I 
                        plan to add a tool for the user to test their knowledge on how to make each cocktail, with 
                        the end goal of providing users with a means to learn a new skill that could get them 
                        a job as a bartender. Considering the API contains a total of 623 drinks, there is much 
                        room to grow here.
